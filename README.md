<h1>002_get_next_line</h1>
<h3>Function which returns a line read from a file descriptor. Calling function in a loop will then allow to read the text available on a file descriptor one line at a time until the EOF.</h3>

<blockquote>This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.</blockquote>
